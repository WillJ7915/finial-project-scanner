# Project Title: Network Vulnerability Scanner and Report Generator
# Overview: Written bash script that generates a static report outline and saves this outline to a text file. This final vulnerability report will examine a designated network, asses points of concern and advise on remediation efforts to improve potential compromised systems.
# Purpose/Learning: This bash script will serve as a learning tool and gained experience in network vulnerability scanning. 
# Current Status: Bash script is formatted into eight categories, code functions have been included, and output scanner results are defined to "net_scan_rpt.txt". Categories are as follows: 1. Operating System Detection; 2. Open Ports and Detection Services; 3. SSL/TLS Configuration; 4. Firewall and Security Tools Detected; 5. Potential Vulnerabilities Identified; 6. Detected Services Version Information; 7. Recommendations for Remediation; 8. Notes and Analyst Comments. Two of eight sections configured for scanning (1 and 2 complete). Color coding has been implemented for visual ascetics. 
# Future Goals: Complete remaining sections prior to 15 August 2025.
